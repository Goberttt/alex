# alex
An attempt at a quoridor AI terminal application.


How to install:

1: Install Cargo -> https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

if you are on Windows make sure you install Cargo and not just the Rust compiler.

2: Clone the repository:

  -> On windows there should be a bash shell with git (search for bash). If there is nothing you can install a free tool: https://gitforwindows.org/
 
  -> Open a terminal where you want the files to go and type clone git https://github.com/Goberttt/alex.git
  
  -> If you have a lot of free time you can also just create the files yourself and copy the source code (not recommended).

3: Go into the folder alex with the terminal and type cargo run. This will compile the program and run it. Dont worry about possible warnings. That is just my lazy programming for now. I will fix these later.

4: Have fun!
