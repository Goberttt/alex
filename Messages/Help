General: The following commands are supported
    help,
    new,
    move,
    show,
    set,
    unset and
    brute.
    Type 'help <command>' to get help about a command.
    Type 'help encoding' to get help about the current move encoding.

New: Creates a new board.

Move: Must be followed by a move or a sequence of moves. For example
    'move N S N S' or 'move e2 e8 e3h', depending on the encoding used.

Show: Prints the current board.

Set: Sets a flag or changes the move encoding used. The flags are
    invert - inverts the view of the board, i.e. rotates the board by 180 degrees
    more to come...
    The encoding keywords are 'cardinal' and 'absolute'

Unset: Unsets a flag. The flags are
    invert - inverts the view of the board, i.e. rotates the board by 180 degrees
    more to come...

Brute: Tries to solve the current board position by depth first search/dynamic programming.
    It should return the player that will win from the current position.
    However, it is still unstable and obviously only works for very simple board positions.
    Will crash if the computers memory is used up.
    You can use the '_fill' command to fill unused areas of the board.
    This makes it easier for the algorithm.
    '_fill' is followed by four numbers, which are choordinates of the lower left and upper right corners to fill.
    For example '_fill 0 0 7 7' fills the entire board with walls.

Encoding: Two encodings for moves are supported, cardinal and algebraic.
    In cardinal notation, a move is encoded by specifying its direction.
    Moving up is 'N', down is 'S', left is 'W' and right is 'E'.
    A jump is encoded by two consecutive moves, for example 'NN' is a jump two spaces up and 'NW' is a diagonal jump.
    Wall are encoded by a 'H' for horizontal or 'V' for vertical followed by the choordinates of the centre of the wall.
    Type 'show' to see the choordinate system (set cardinal notation with 'set cardinal'). An example is 'Hd3'.
    /////////
    In absolute notation, a move is encoded by the chordinates of the player after the move. Type 'show' to see the choordinate system (set absolute notation with 'set absolute').
    A Wall is encoded by the choordinates of its lower left tile followed by 'h' for horizontal or 'v' for vertival. An example is 'e3h'.

WrongInput: I'm sorry, I don't understand the input. Type 'help' for help.
